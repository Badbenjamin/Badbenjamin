## Hi! I'm Ben! ðŸ“¹ðŸ’¾ðŸŽ¶

  I'm a filmmaker who learned computer programming to bring 3D models to life. I love taking real world data and mapping it to 3D models/environments. I'm currently working on a 3D map of the NYC subway system. Here are a few of my projects...

MY 3D TRAINS - A 3D map of the NYC subway system. Plan a trip, record your commute times, view the subway in realtime in 3D... Coming soon! Demo below...
