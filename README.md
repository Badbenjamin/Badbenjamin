## Hi! I'm Ben! ðŸ“¹ðŸ’¾ðŸŽ¶

  I'm a software engineer who learned to code through an interest in 3D computer graphics that led me to Three.js. I have a special interest in 3D data visualization. I love taking real world data and mapping it to 3D models/environments. I thought I would drawn mostly to frontend engineering, but I found out that I really enjoy Python as well. I get a kick out of solving problems! I'm currently working on a 3D map of the NYC subway system. Here are a few of my projects...

MY 3D TRAINS - A 3D map of the NYC subway system. Plan a trip, record your commute times, view the subway in realtime in 3D... Coming soon! Demo below...
